# learnable_activation

Problem Statement: Use a 1-hidden layer neural network model that adapts to the most suitable activation function according to the data-set. The ANN model can learn for itself the best AF to use by exploiting a flexible functional form, k0 + k1 âˆ— x with parameters k0, k1 being learned from multiple runs.
